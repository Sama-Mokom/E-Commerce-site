# Quick Market

overview 


1. Introduction

This project aims to develop an e-commerce platform that connects local sellers with buyers in Buea and other regions of Cameroon. The website will function as a marketplace, akin to eBay, facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers rather than selling products directly. The goal is to provide a convenient and accessible solution for people in the region to buy and sell goods.

2. Problem Statement

Currently, there is a lack of online platforms in Buea and surrounding areas that enable local sellers to reach a broader audience. Existing e-commerce solutions often do not effectively cater to the needs of local markets, making it difficult for sellers to showcase their products. This project seeks to address this gap by creating a localized online marketplace that helps sellers connect with customers and enables buyers to find the products they need.

3. Objectives

Develop a user-friendly e-commerce platform that replicates the functionalities of platforms like eBay.

Provide a space where local sellers in Buea and other areas in Cameroon can list their products for sale.

Simplify the buying process for customers, enabling them to search for products, communicate with sellers, and make purchases securely.

Integrate features such as user registration, product categories, and a review system to foster trust.


4. System Overview

The platform will comprise a front-end interface designed with HTML and CSS, while Java will handle the back-end functionalities, including user management, product listings, and transaction processing. The system will include:

User registration and login functionalities for buyers and sellers.

Product listings with search and filtering capabilities.

A seller dashboard for managing listings and orders.

Buyer cart and checkout functionalities.

A messaging system to facilitate communication between buyers and sellers.


5. Technologies Used

Front-end: HTML and CSS for a responsive design.

Back-end: Java to manage server-side logic.

Database: SQL for storing user and product data.

Additional Tools: Version control with Git and potentially a cloud service for hosting.


6. Security

An escrow payment system will be implemented to enhance transaction security. Payments made by buyers will be held in an escrow account upon purchase and will remain frozen until the buyer confirms receipt of the product. Once confirmed, the payment will be released to the seller. In cases of disputes or lack of confirmation, the funds will stay locked until the issue is resolved.
